Seamless voice chat with AI.

# Idea
A lot of people have done this before me. I want to give this a try using [zeroMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq) to pass messages between the different components. This should make it easier to add extra features like interruptions if the user begins speaking while the AI is talking.

Below is a basic diagram of the architecture I have in mind. It is subject to change as I learn more about this problem:
